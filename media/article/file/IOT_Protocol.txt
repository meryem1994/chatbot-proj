An IoT-specific protocol is a type of network protocol that is specifically designed to be used with the Internet of Things (IoT). These protocols are designed to enable communication between IoT devices and other devices or systems, often over long distances and with low power consumption. Some examples of IoT-specific protocols include:
MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport): MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol that is used to facilitate communication between devices in an IoT network. It is designed to be efficient, with low overhead and low power consumption, making it well-suited for use in IoT applications.
CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol): CoAP is a RESTful protocol that is designed to be used in resource-constrained environments, such as those found in IoT devices. It is based on the HTTP protocol and is designed to be simple and easy to implement, making it well-suited for use in IoT applications.
Zigbee: Zigbee is a wireless communication protocol that is used to connect devices in an IoT network. It is designed to be low-power, low-cost, and easy to use, making it well-suited for use in IoT applications.
Other network service protocols, such as HTTP and TCP/IP, are not specific to the IoT and are used more broadly in various types of networks and applications. These protocols are designed to facilitate communication between devices and systems, but they are not specifically designed for use in the resource-constrained environments that are common in IoT applications.
